Room Templates
==============

Every room must belong to a template. Templates provide a way to assign information that is common to multiple rooms in a single place instead of having to apply similar information to individual rooms. 

**Template Name**  
: Name to identify the template

**Description**  
: A note so that future maintainers of the system know what this templated was
supposed to be used for.

**From Email**  
: Override the default building "From" email address

**URL**  
: A web link to describe the rooms to the patrons. Can be an external URL or a link to a snippet

**Map URL**  
: A web link to show the location of the room on a map.

**Policy**  
: The policy that applies to this template
